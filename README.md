# GOAL

This is a demo to show-case how to implement .

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

### 1. Add the gem
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'rqrcode'
```
Remember to `bundle install`

### 2. Create a new feature to display the QR code
  * A new Route
  ```ruby
  # config/routes.rb
    resources :restaurants do
      member do
        get :qr_code
      end
    end
  ```
  * A new Controller#Action
  ```ruby
  # app/controllers/restaurants_controller.rb
  require 'rqrcode'
  class RestaurantsController < ApplicationController
    def qr_code
      @restaurant = Restaurant.find(params[:id])

      # this comes from the documentation
      qrcode = RQRCode::QRCode.new(restaurant_url(@restaurant))
      @svg = qrcode.as_svg(
        offset: 0,
        color: '000',
        shape_rendering: 'crispEdges',
        module_size: 6,
        standalone: true
      )
    end
  end
  ```
  * A new [View](app/views/restaurants/qr_code.html.erb)

Now, we can go to http://localhost:3000/restaurants/1/qr_code and see the QR code!
If you want to read this QR code with your smartphone, the app must be online (not on localhost).

And we're good to go ðŸ¤“
